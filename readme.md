# Welcome my Etch-A-Sketch Project from The Odin Project

---

## What I learned on this project :

- The use of mousedown, mouseup and mouseover events
- Using events

## Features to add :

- Add eraser to erase specific parts of the sketch
- ~~Add shading feature, a progressive darkening effect where each interaction adds 10% more black or color to the square. The objective is to achieve a completely black square only after ten interactions.~~
- ~~Add rainbow mode to randomise the color output~~
